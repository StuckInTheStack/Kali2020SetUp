# SetUp

This collection of files is part of my setup script to customize a new Kali install (2020.3).  It is particular to my taste with collections of privilege escalation tools that I download in bulk on a compromised host in linuxtools and wintools while less used privilege escalation tools are in toolslinuxall and toolswinall.  I also download some wallpapers I prefer.  Feel free to use the tools in the repository here, but customize the script and folders to your taste.  

This script is built on scripts from   https://github.com/g0tmi1k/os-scripts  https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity
